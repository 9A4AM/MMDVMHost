G0WFV's HD44780 todo list ...

As I only have a 2x16 screen at the moment, development has been done based
on this size screen.

Some additions I can translate to the other size screens without connecting
the physical screen (and I will do eventually once I get the code working 
for the 2x16!)  I am however getting some 4x16 screens to play with so 
expect more reliable progress in this area!

Here's a list of things I need to accomplish in the near future ...

- Propagate non-duplex (DVMega) screen usage changes to other size screens
  as appropriate.

- Propagate custom characters for rf and ip sources to other screens 
  Currently only states "R" or "N" for RF or network traffic, which is nice
  but there are now custom characters for this!
