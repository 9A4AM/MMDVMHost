D-Star: No obvious issues.

DMR: There is an issue where transmitted data (text messages) isn’t picked up as reliably from an MMDVM than (say) a Hytera repeater. In order to address this, I need to see a trace from a Hytera repeater transmitting text, both from cold (no tx) and when already running. The DMRRX receiver from the DV4RX code in my GitHub repository would do the job, provided you have a DV4mini and a repeater within range.

YSF: There are a number of issues that need addressing:
1.	At the end of a transmission, my radio does a nice bleep when it’s listening to a DR-1X but not when receiving from my MMDVM. I don’t know why. I think the YSFRX from DV4RX may be able to give the answer.
2.	The data sent to aprs.fi from southern hemisphere users isn’t always correct. Maybe the GPS format used by YSF still has some secrets to reveal.
3.	The last page of Wires-X data doesn’t display. A trace of a complete listing from a “real” Wires-X system, right down to the last page would be useful. Yet again the YSFRX would be useful here.

P25: No obvious issues.
